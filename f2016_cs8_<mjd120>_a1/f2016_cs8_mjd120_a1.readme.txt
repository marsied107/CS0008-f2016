To create the program I first began by having the user input 1 or 2 for what system they're using. The program then later
used this input to calculate things. Next I asked the user for their input of how far they drove and how much gas they used.
They entered these numbers as floats and enter there system using integers. From there i used an if statement to determine
what system they were using and convert the numbers from that system to the other. After this the program then does the
calculations to determine the fuel consumption for both systems. The next step uses an if else stament to compute the
the fuel consumption rating based on the table given. Lastly i printed that data out in the table format and using the 3
decimal place format required.
